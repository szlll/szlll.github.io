Hi! I am a Ph.D. student at [Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence](http://ai.ruc.edu.cn), [Renmin University of China](https://www.ruc.edu.cn), where I am advised by Prof. [Zhiwu Lu](https://gsai.ruc.edu.cn/luzhiwu). I am interested in Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM) and Image Synthesis. Specifically, I am now working on (1) User Intent-aware Retrieval and Generation; (2) Reasoning Arugment for LVLM.
